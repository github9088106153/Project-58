        <p class="para"> Drawing is my favorite hobby.It is so much fun. I cannot imagine a colorful life without drawing. It needs a lot of devotion as well as practice. I can never feel bored when I have my colors with me. My colors are my best friend. I like drawing since I was 6 years old. Every year I gift my grandparents and parents with my drawing on their anniversaries.
